By command, $pyhton nearest neighbor.py input.txt,the program, nearest_neighbor.py, can calculate the distance between the closest pair of points in the input file, input.txt, which created by the program generate_test.py.
The result will be output to a output file, input_distance.txt.
For example,
Input File: input.txt
5.1 8.7
-1.2 3.7
-4.5 -6.1
12.7 14.21
1.6 3.1
7.9 15.13
18.4 -25.3
11.2 -6.3
7.1 -3.9
4.6 2.9
Output File: input_distance.txt
